[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

 A web-based application that provides various formulas for calculating the volume and area of ​​3-dimensional figure, as well as calculating the area and perimeter of 2-dimensional shapes. In short, the user will be spoiled for doing geometric calculations by simply entering the numerical parameters of each 2D or 3D shape and the calculation results will quickly appear.

- See HTML in the right
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

1. Calculation of volume and area formulas for 3-dimensional spaces including cylinders, cones, blocks, cubes, spheres. the user only needs to enter the size of the parameter according to the shape of the space to be calculated.
2. Calculation of volume and area formulas for 2-dimensional shapes including rectangles, circles, triangles, parallelograms, trapezoids. and rectangle. the user only needs to enter the parameter values ​​according to the 2D image to be calculated.
3. Account, where there are login and logout features, as well as new user registration.
4. Contact Us, this feature functions so that users can provide suggestions, questions and statements for developers.


## Tech

This application is built using:
